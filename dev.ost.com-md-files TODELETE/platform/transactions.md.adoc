== Transactions Types

There are two different types of transactions possible, company to user and user initiated.
The latter must be signed by the users private keys on their mobile device.

| Transaction Type | Description

| *company-to-user*
| Client company to end-user + *Our Server Side SDKs (available in link:/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/php/[PHP], link:/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/ruby/[Ruby], link:/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/nodejs/[Node.js], link:/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/java/[Java]).
facilitate company-to-user transactions*

| *user initiated*
| End-user to another user OR end-user to the client company + *Our Mobile Wallet SDKs (available in link:/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/android/[Android], link:/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/iOS[iOS], link:/platform/docs/sdk/mobile-wallet-sdks/iOS[React Native]) facilitate user initiated transactions.
The mobile wallet is used to sign transactions.*

Each transaction is defined by a *Rules* contract.
OST provides two *Rules* contracts out of the box:

* `directTransfer`: Transfer Tokens
* `pay`: Transfer fiat value

== Example

If a client company wants to transfer tokens worth USD5 to a user the following sequence of events occur:

. Company's TokenHolder contract initiates "`execute pricer rule`" request to client company's *PricerRule* contract.
. The TokenHolder contract also approves company's *TokenRules* contract to spend tokens on its behalf.
. Company's *PricerRule* contract applies "`conversion from USD to tokens rules`".
The *PricerRule* contract will pass all this information after applying rules to the *TokenRules* contract.
. The *TokenRules* contract executes the transfer between all concerned parties as specified by the company's *PricerRule* contract.
