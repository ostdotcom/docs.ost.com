:::tip Create Token > Plan and Design > Start Integration > Launch to End-users!
| Step | Description | Skillset | Approx Duration |  | -- | -- | :--: | :--: | | *1.
Create token* | <ul><li>Register on OST Platform</li><li>Choose token name and identifier</li><li>Associate an ETH address</li><li>Stake and mint</li><li>Connect to OST Wallet App</li></ul> | Non-technical | < 1 day | :::

== a. Sign-up on OST Platform

The first thing you need to do to get started with OST Platform is to https://platform.ost.com/sign-up[sign-up for an account].
You will have to activate your account using the activation link sent to you upon registration.

:::note OST Platform is Available on Desktop Only Given the requirement to use MetaMask, OST Platform is available on *desktop only* using either Chrome or Firefox.
If you navigate to the sign-up link above on mobile, you will be prompted to use a desktop browser.
:::

image::/platform/docs/assets/token-setup/register.png[create-account]

To enhance your experience on OST Platform, we ask you to provide your company name, whether your product has a mobile application, and current estimate of monthly active users (MAU).

image::/platform/docs/assets/token-setup/additional_information.png[create-account]

== b. Choose token name and identifier

During token setup you will set Token Name and select a Token Identifier for your Token.
You also need to set the conversion rate between your Token and the staked value token (e.g.
OST Token, USDC).

image::/platform/docs/assets/token-setup/token_setup.png[create-account]

:::note Character Restrictions

* *Token Name:* Letters, numbers, spaces allowed, max 20 characters and 3 words
* *Token Identifier:* No special characters allowed, Min 1 letter required, Max 4 letters or numbers :::

:::warning Conversion Rate We recommend using the default conversion rate in Sandbox i.e.
1 token = 1 OST.
You can then make a more informed decision when setting-up your Token in Production.
If you need help setting the conversion rate, you can reach out to us at support@ost.com.

Things to consider when setting the conversion rate:

* Fiat value of each token (this will be subject to change if you stake a non-stablecoin)
* Fiat value of each action
* Typical token denomination: 10s, 100s, 1000s?
:::

== c. Associate an ETH Address

:::note Install MetaMask (in Production) MetaMask is required to participate in OST Platform in Production.
*You can proceed without MetaMask in Sandbox.* :::

image::/platform/docs/assets/token-setup/optional_metamask.png[create-account]

* MetaMask provides a browser plugin to create an Etheruem address and wallet.
You can opt to use your own Ethereum address if you have one.
The address that you use will be the Account Owner Address.
* The MetaMask wallet is used to sign for the token creation transactions on Ethereum ropsten test network.
* In OST Platform Sandbox, you will receive an initial allotment / stake of USDC-Test or USDC-Test.
You can use this stake to Mint your Tokens in Sandbox.
* In Production, you can choose to associate a hardware wallet address using MetaMask's interface (two hardware wallets are supported: Trezor and Ledger).

image::/platform/docs/assets/token-setup/install_metamask.png[Two-Factor Authentication]

image::/platform/docs/assets/token-setup/account_setup.png[create-account]

:::warning Account Owner Address

* This is an important address.
If you lose the associated private key, you will lose access to Tokens you mint.
* You associate the owner address with OST Platform by doing a personal signature.
This signature is to ensure you as a user are the owner of the MetaMask account and it's real.
:::

Once you associate the owner address the token set-up process starts.
This process involves running multiple blockchain transactions on Ethereum blockchain and OpenST Side Chains, so the process takes several minutes to complete.

:::

== a. Buy, earn, spend, redeem actions

The primary drivers in an ecosystem are buy, earn, spend, and redeem.
These must be balanced in order to have a well functioning and  sustainable ecosystem.

|===
| Action | Example

| Buy
| Tokens purchased with fiat

| Earn
| Compensation in return for micro-contributions, services or tasks performed

| Spend
| Payment for merch, other assets, services or tasks

| Redeem (cash-out)
| Tokens are redeemed for gift cards, other crypto, or fiat
|===

== b. What to stake?

With OST Platform you can stake either USDC (a stablecoin) or OST tokens.

=== Why Stake a Stablecoin?

By default, Tokens are backed by staking OST tokens on Ethereum mainnet.
Their value is backed by OST tokens at a fixed conversion rate set by you when you first create your BT.
As a result, the value of your BT rises and falls with the market-determined price of OST tokens.

If you would like your BTs to have a stable value, you can back them by staking stablecoins instead of OST tokens.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimise the effects of market-driven price volatility by being backed by a fiat currency, such as US Dollars.
By staking stablecoins, you minimize fluctuations in the value of your BT.

:::note USDC USDC is a type of stablecoin where each USDC issued and in circulation is backed by $1 USD held in a bank account audited monthly.
This backing means that 1 USDC can always be redeemed for US$1.00.
This effectively gives USDC a stable price.
:::

image::/platform/docs/assets/token-setup/token_setup.png[create-account]

== c. Conversion Rate

The Conversion Rate is the value of a Token relative to the underlying stake, the value token.
OST Platform sets a default conversation rate of 1BT = 1OST.
If you like, you can set an alternative conversion rate by selecting Edit under Advanced Options.

We recommend using the default conversion rate in Sandbox i.e.
1 BT = 1 OST.
You can then make a more informed decision when setting-up your Token in Production.
If you need help setting the conversion rate, you can reach out to us at support@ost.com.

Things to consider when setting the conversion rate:

* Fiat value of each token (this will be subject to change if you stake a non-stablecoin)
* Fiat value of each action
* Typical token denomination: 10s, 100s, 1000s?

:::warning Conversion Rate

* Once you mint your token, the conversion rate is fixed and cannot be changed.
* Conversion rates do not transfer from Sandbox to Production and must be set again during the token setup in the Production environment.

== d. Mobile and web UX and design

We have provided link:/platform/docs/ux/[Wallet UX Guidelines] with screens and flows and helpful suggestions to get you started!
We are also working on making available UI screens through our Wallet SDKs.
These will be available in Aug / Sep 2019.

== a. Access your API and WebHook keys and secrets

Log-in to OST Platform and go to the *Developers* tab.
There you can find your API and Webhook keys and secrets.
You need to confirm your email address before getting access.

image::/platform/docs/assets/dev_page.png[start-your-integration]

:::note API Requests Every API request has 4 mandatory parameters that must be included:

* `api_key`: the API key as provided from developers page inside OST Platform dashboard.
* `api_request_timestamp`: the current unix timestamp in seconds.
* `api_signature`: the signature as the sha256 digest of the shared API secret and the correctly formatted query string as described below.
* `api_signature_kind`: the value for this parameter should be OST1-HMAC-SHA256.
:::

== b. Review technical guides

Check-out our technical implementation guides for an overview of how to approach the integration, best practices, and tips.
You can find these in the main menu on the left.

== c. Decide which APIs/SDKs to use

=== Server Side SDKs

* link:/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/php/[PHP]
* link:/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/ruby/[Ruby]
* link:/platform/docs/sdk/server-side-sdks/java/[Java]

== d. Perform test transactions

Perform test transactions in Sandbox to ensure everything is working as expected!
Check our link:/platform/docs/go-live-checklist/[Go-Live Checklist] for a list of things to consider.

:::tip user_ID Map When you integrate Tokens into your application, please remember to:

* Create and maintain a map of OST Platform user_id to the user's profile on their app
* link:/platform/docs/guides/create-user-wallet/#generate-passphaseprefix[Generate and safely store a 30 character "secret" for each user].
This "secret" is used for the recovery and thus must be unique to each user.
:::

== e. Finalise development and design (Step 2)

After you have conducted tests in Sandbox and have a better feel for the finalise these steps before moving to Step 4

* *Token name and identifier* (in Production, does not need to match Sandbox)
* *What to stake* and how much to stake to being with
* *Conversion rate:* Token to underlying stake / value token
* *Mobile and web UX and design and implementation*

== a. Request to move to Production

To move from Sandbox to Production, click on the toggle switch in https://platform.ost.com[OST Platform dashboard] and follow the instructions.
At the moment, you are required to fill-out a Google Form.

:::note Sandbox The Sandbox will still be available to you after you have been permitted to Production :::

== b. Conduct an initial pilot

We recommend a phased launch and launching to <10,000 users to begin with.
This is to ensure that your Token performs as expected.

== c. Fine-tune token economics

* Is the supply of Tokens sufficient
* Are the actions and token _rewards_ right?
Should token _rewards_ be more or less?

== d. Incorporate more use cases

Following an initial launch, you can rollout to additional customer segments and incorporate more use cases.
If you would like to brainstorm on potential use cases, contact us at support@ost.com.

== e. Assess impact on KPIs e.g. NPS and Retention

* Are goals and objectives being met?
* Is your Token having a material impact on customer engagement and satisfaction?
