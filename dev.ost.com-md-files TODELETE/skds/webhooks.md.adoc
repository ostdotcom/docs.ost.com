= Introduction to OST Platform WebHooks
:id: webhooks
:sidebar_label: WebHooks

Our WebHooks allow you to subscribe to specific events or topics that occur in OST Platform.
Whenever a trigger event occurs the WebHook sees the event, collects the data, and sends it to a URL specified by you in the form of an HTTP request.
Once you receive the data, you can then execute any code on your server app.

*Example:*

. If you subscribe to `users/activation_success` topic then once a user is activated in OST Platform, you will recieve a notification following which you can execute any logic, for example: you can update the user with updated user entity in your database.
. If you subscribe to `transactions/initiate`, you can show receivers of a transaction the transaction details as soon as it is initiated.
Without subscribing to this webhook, receivers would only see these transactions - in their transactions ledger - once it reaches SUCCESS status, i.e.
after it has been mined (6 blocks x 3 secs = 18 secs later).

== Validating WebHook Event Data Using Signature

WebHook event data is validated by creating a digital signature of webhook event data.
Each webhook event data request includes a `header` with name `ost-signature` which is generated using webhook secret.
You can find your webhook secret in the OST Platform dashboard inside developers page.

*Steps to validate the WebHook Event Data*

. Extract these 3 headers values from webhook event data request `ost-timestamp`, `ost-signature`, `ost-version`.
. Pass these 3 values along with `webhook event data` and `webhook secret`.
You can find your webhook secret in the OST Platform dashboard inside Developers page.
