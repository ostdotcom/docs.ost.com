== Tokens
At the core of Ost Platform is the concept of Tokens. Tokens are value-backed tokens created on Etherum and running on scalable side-chains. Tokens serve as a medium of exchange and can be used to power all sorts of actions, increase user retention, and drive growth.

[NOTE]
.Token Have Real-Value
====
Tokens are created by first staking a value token on Ethereum mainnet and using that as a basis to mint new tokens on Ost side-chains.
The value of a token is tied to the value of the underlying stake.

You can currently stake USDC and OST tokens on Ost Platform, however, it is possible to stake any ERC-20 token.

== Branded Token
Mainstream application's value-backed token, designed specifically for its application's context.

== Utility Branded Token
Representation of a BrandedToken on a sidechain, utilized in transactions within an application.

== Contract Address

An Ethereum address represents an account. For external owned accounts, the address is derived as the last 20 bytes of the hash of the public key controlling the account, e.g. cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826. 

This is a hexadecimal format (base 16 notation), which is often indicated explicitly by prepending 0x to the address. Since each byte of the address is represented by 2 hex characters, a prefixed address is 42 characters long.

== Owner/Device Key

* This is a private key created on the mobile device of the end-user.
This private key is limited to the device and the person with access to the device.
It has a corresponding public key, which in-turn has a corresponding public address.
* This public address - also known as device address - can be configured as the owner of the user's TokenHolder contract.

== Ephemeral Session Keys

* In order to create a seamless user experience so that users don't have to sign a new transaction at every move we came up with the concept of disposable sessionKeys.
* Disposable in the sense that they are used to sign messages on a users behalf for a predetermined amount of time and with a defined maximum spending limit per-transaction.
* These keys are created on the mobile device of the end-user
* The configured owner of a TokenHolder contract can authorize sessionKeys.

== uuid v4

Each and every bit of a UUID v4 is generated randomly and with no inherent logic.

== Tx Hash

Transaction hash is an identifier used to uniquely identify a particular transaction. All on-chain transactions have a unique transaction hash that can be seen in transaction details. A transaction hash usually looks like a random set of letters and numbers.

== Pessimistic Debit

For a sender in OST platform the step of a transaction in OST Platform is pessimistic debit. Pessimistic debit is a temporary debit from senders account, the debit will be settled once the transaction is confirmed on origin-chain.

== Smart Contracts

During the set-up stage, multiple smart-contracts are deployed on Ethereum and OpenST Mosaic scalable sidechains.

=== Context
* User funds are held in a TokenHolder contract, a public address where funds are held on the blockchain
* Access to/ownership of the TokenHolder contract is governed by a MultiSig contract or a list of private keys. Each trusted device is equivalent to a private key.
* A user's wallet includes a TokenHolder contract, a MultiSig contract and a DelayedRecoveryModule contract. The DelayedRecoveryModule is owned by a key that is created using inputs from the user (a 6 digit PIN), the Partner, and Ost.
* Users can revoke device access to the TokenHolder contract via device management
* To add additional, remove or replace owner keys, a pre-agreed number of existing owners must sign the transaction. This pre-agreed number of required signatures is intuitively called the threshold of the MultiSig.

.Smart Contracts
|===
|Contract Name 
|Description

| TokenHolder
| - Where a user's balance sits. It "holds" the tokens for the user on blockchain.

- A user that has a TokenHolder contract associated with their id can earn and spend tokens

- The TokenHolder contract has a configured owner and has multiple disposable keys called `sessionKeys`

- Tokens that belong to them are mapped to the address of the TokenHolder contract

- Each user is represented by a smart contract. This smart contract is the TokenHolder contract.

- Whenever an end-user does an action, a rule execution request is initialized. This contract verifies that this request is initiated by an authorized key. The authorized key can be an owner key or a session key.

| DeviceManager ("MultiSig")
| - The purpose of this DeviceManager contract is to enable multiple parties - devices in our case - to have authority over one TokenHolder contract.

- The MultiSig controls the TokenHolder contract, as its owner

- Allows users to access funds of a TokenHolder contract from multiple devices

- The public addresses from certain keys generated on the user's devices are set as owners of the MultiSig and are authorized as sessionKeys in the TokenHolder.

- In the current implementation, we use the GnosisSafe smart contract for the multi-signature contract.

| Rules Contract
| - To enable client companies to design custom Rules that align with their goals and define the behavior of the token transfer, OpenST protocol came up with contracts for "client companies".

- Each Rules contract contains a specific piece of business logic and can be be written and deployed by anyone.

- Each company will have at least one custom Rules Contract: https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/openst-contracts/blob/develop/contracts/rules/PricerRule.sol[*PricerRule*]

- Rules that transfer value are required to be registered. Registering is the process of whitelisting a rule for use.

| PricerRule
| - Rule for transferring tokens in amounts equivalent to selected other currencies (EUR, GBP, USD)

| TokenRules
| - Maintains a list of the *Rules* contracts that can execute transfers

- Enables developers to register and deregister specific *Rules* contracts

- Each Company will have one *TokenRules* contract deployed on an auxiliary chain

- For executing a token transfer, an end-users TokenHolder contract interacts with TokenRules and Rules contracts.


| DelayedRecoveryModule
| - Supports recovery via a 6 digit PIN

- The public addresses of the recoveryOwner and the recoveryController are stored on this contract.

- A number that represents blocks added to the blockchain, to approximate a period of delay before recovery can be executed (e.g., 14400 == 12 hours, assuming a block is added every 3 seconds), is also stored on this contract, as the recoveryBlockDelay.

|===


[NOTE] 
.RecoveryOwner
====
The recoveryOwner is created using inputs from the client, Ost and the user.

* The user's input is a 6 digit PIN.
* The client and Ost must provide pseudorandom inputs that are mapped to the user.
* For the sake of clarity, the client's input shall be referred to as the client User Secret and Ost's input shall be referred to as Ost User Salt.

These inputs are put through a cryptographically-sound key generation process (such as Scrypt) to create the private key that will be used as the recoveryOwner for the DelayedRecoveryModule.
====

[NOTE]
.GnosisSafe 
====
Using GnosisSafe as the MultiSig enables us to use "executable transactions" (transactions that are signed by one key, but for which the computations are paid by a different key), per EIP-1077.

As a result, owner keys do not need to the hold base currency to pay for gas.
